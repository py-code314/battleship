## Overview

This is an online two player Battleship game where each player secretly arranges a fleet of ships on a 10 x 10 grid. In this game, players take turns shooting at the other player's ships by clicking on the enemy grid squares. The shots are marked with 'red' for a hit and 'orange' for a miss. When a player hits all ship squares of a ship, they sink the ship. The game ends when one player sinks all of the other player's ships. The first player to sink all of the opponent's ships wins.


### Rules

- Each player places their ships (The AI places its ships randomly, and it cannot see where you've placed your ships).
- The ships may not overlap or touch each other and they can only be placed within the grid boundaries.
- The ships can be placed either horizontally or vertically, but never diagonally.
- The players take turns taking shots at squares. The results are either "hit" or "miss".
- The winner is the first player to sink all of the other player's ships.


### Instructions

- Click 'Randomize' button to place ships randomly.
- Drag and drop ships to move them to a different position.
- Change ship direction by clicking on any of its squares.
- Pick between Standard and Advanced Computer levels.
- Click 'Play' button to start the game.
- Click 'Reset' button to reset the game.
- Click on a enemy board square to make a move. It turns 'red' for a successful hit and 'orange' for a missed hit.
- Watch 'Messages' box to see game updates.
